## Environment Setup

This application uses Supabase for authentication and database. Make sure your Supabase project is properly set up with the necessary tables and Row Level Security policies.

### Setting Up the `.env` File

The application requires environment variables to connect to Supabase. Create a `.env` file in the root of your project and add the following variables:

```env
SUPABASE_URL=<your-supabase-url>
SUPABASE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=<your-supabase-publishable-key>
```

Replace `<your-supabase-url>` and `<your-supabase-publishable-key>` with the values from your Supabase project.

> **Note:** Do not commit the `.env` file to version control. It is already included in the `.gitignore` file.

## Deploying to Production
